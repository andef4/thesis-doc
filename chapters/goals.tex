\chapter*{Goals}

\section{Infrastructure and technology}
This work will use the PyTorch\cite{paszke2017automatic} deep learning library. Most newer machine learning papers are written with PyTorch, because it is considered easier to learn and more powerful than Keras and PyTorch\cite{pytorchvstensorflow}.

\section*{NIH Chest X-Ray}
Use a basic image classificiation problem from the mediacal imaging field to evaluate methods.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use the NIH chest x-ray dataset
    \item Learn a standard architecture for image classification on the model using PyTorch (e.g. Inception, ResNet)
    \item Apply methods on the output of the network
\end{itemize}
Goals
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine which methods are directly usable with a PyTorch model or require low porting effort
    \item Determine which methods are independent of the used network architecture (methods that view the model as a black box)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Brain tumors}
The first thing we want to learn is the medical background of the thesis, answering the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are brain tumors?
    \item What types of brain tumors exists?
    \item How do they look like on a scan? What scanner types exists (MRI/PET/CT)? Which one is used when?
    \item How does a scan look like? Colors? Layers? 2D/3D images?
    \item How does a doctor analyze such a scan?
\end{itemize}

\section*{The BraTS dataset}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What scanner is used and what tumor types are detected?
    \item What data format is used to save the scans?
    \item In what format is the labeling saved?
    \item Build a loader for the dataset
    \item Display some scans
\end{itemize}

\section*{Neural Network}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Research current state of the art networks for image segmentation
    \item Investigate U-Net architectures
    \item Build and train network for the BraTS dataset in PyTorch based on an existing architecture
    \item Investigate and if necessary/helpful implement data augmentation for the dataset
\end{itemize}




\section*{LIME}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigate how LIME works
    \item Figure out how to use LIME in image segmentation tasks, examples found until now only for classification
    \item Implement LIME for the neural network implemented above
\end{itemize}

\section*{Visualization Tools}
Visualizing and UnderstandingConvolutional Networks
https://cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/papers/zeilerECCV2014.pdf

\section*{RISE (optional)}
Randomized Input Sampling for Explanations
\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigate how RISE works
    \item Figure out how to use RISE in image segmentation tasks

\end{itemize}

\section{iNNvestigate}
https://github.com/albermax/innvestigate

\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure out how to use iNNvestigate in image segmentation tasks
    \item Check if a port to 
\end{itemize}



\section*{Library}
Build a library with a common interface for the implemented tools, so that all of them can be applied easily.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write example programs for the library to use with PyTorch
    \item (Optional) Write example programs for the library to use with TensorFlow
    \item Write documentation how to use the library
    \item (Optional) Publish on conda
    \item (Optional) Publish on PyPI
    
\end{itemize}
