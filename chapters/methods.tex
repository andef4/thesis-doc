\section{Lime}
LIME\cite{todo} stands for X

Interprets models as blackboxes. Covers parts of the image with a mask.

Examples for PyTorch, unknown simple porting to pytorch would be => TODO investiage


\section{RISE}
Similar technology as LIME, uses PyTorch. Newer than LIME, paper asserts to be better.

Written for PyTorch





\section{Method types}
One of the main questions we have to answer is which methods for interpretability can be used on an Image Segmentation task.
Generally there are two types of methods for interpretability: Blackbox and whitebox.
Blackbox methods like LIME or RISE do not need an understanding of the underlying model and can therefore be used on arbitrary network architectures and even non-deep learning technologies like decision trees.
Whitebox methods need to have access to the underling model, because they analyze a certain part of the network (e.g. extracted features).

\subsection{Blackbox}
Blackbox methods modify the input image, run it trough the network and then analyze how the im
