These are also saved as 2 byte integers with the values 0 (not tumor), 1 (todo), 2(todo) and 4(todo).

Every layer is saved as a 2 byte signed integer. We convert these to 1 byte unsigned integers and scale the range to 0-255, so the highest value in the 2 byte signed integer is 255 and the lowest is 0.
This way we generate a grayscale image that can be viewed with a normal image viewer and should be processable by a normal convolutional neural network
