\section{BraTS 2018 dataset}
The BraTS dataset \cite{menze2015multimodal} contains MRI scans of the human brain. It is provided by the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) but contains data from many different clinical institutes.
We use the 2018 version of the dataset, which contains new scans and revised ground truth segments.

\subsection{Data format}
The data is provided in the NIfTI file format (file ending *.nii.gz). It can be opened by the Python library NiBabel\cite{nibabel} which transforms the data into ordinary numpy arrays.

\subsection{Ground truth/labels}
The dataset contains ground truth segments with the following tissue types:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gadolinium-enhancing tumor (ET - label value 4)
    \item Peritumoral edema (ED - label value 2),
    \item Necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core (NCR/NET - label value 1)
\end{itemize}

The labels are also saved in the NIfTI file format, using the integer values from above for every tissue type.
