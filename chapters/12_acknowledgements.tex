I would like the to thank the following persons who helped me to successfully complete this thesis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Peter von Niederhäusern (Advisor): For a ton of guidance on how to write a scientific bachelor thesis, his endless stream of ideas how to improve the many parts of this thesis and the extensive corrections on the drafts of this document.
    \item Mauricio Reyes (Constituent): For a very interesting project assignment in a field that has real world impact. His knowledge in the medical and computer science field and specifically in the new field of machine learning interpretability was enormously helpful.
    \item Andreas Spichiger (Expert): For input how to juggle expectations from different stakeholders and his clear message that results that are usable by other people trump everything else in a thesis.
    \item Alain Jungo (Student in Mauricios University Group): For his introduction to the BraTS dataset and his advice how to extract slices from the volumes and the training of the U-Net model.
    \item Michael Müller (Student in Mauricios University Group): For his help to get the Docker containers for the BraTS 3D dataset running.
    \item Marina Horner (Girlfriend): For her (almost) infinite patience in a stressful time.
\end{itemize}
