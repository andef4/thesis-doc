I would like the to thank the following people which helped me to deliver a successful thesis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Peter von Niederhäusern (Advisor): For a ton of input how to do write a scientific bachelor thesis, his advice how to clearly explain an idea and his endless stream of ideas.
    \item Mauricio Reyes (Constituent): For a very interesting project assignment in a field that has real world impact. His knowledge in the medical and computer science field and specifically in the new field of machine learning interpretability was enormously helpful.
    \item Andreas Spichiger (Expert): For input how to juggle expectations from different stackeholders and his clear message that results that are usable by other people trump everything else in a thesis.
    \item Alain Jungo (Student in Mauricios Group): For his introduction into the BraTS dataset, his advice how to extract slices from volumes and the training of the U-Net model.
    \item Michael Müller (Student in Mauricios Group): For his help to get the Docker containers for the BraTS 3D dataset to work.
    \item Marina Horner (Girlfriend): For her (almost) infinite patience in a stressful time.
\end{itemize}
