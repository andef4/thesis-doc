\section{Whitebox and blackbox methods}
One of the main questions we have to answer is which methods for interpretability can be used on an Image Segmentation task.
Generally there are two types of methods for interpretability: Blackbox and whitebox. Blackbox methods like LIME or RISE do not need insight into the underlying model and can therefore be used on arbitrary network architectures and even non-deep learning technologies like decision trees.

Whitebox methods need to have access to the underling model (e.g. weights and activation values in a neural network), because they analyze a certain part of the network.
