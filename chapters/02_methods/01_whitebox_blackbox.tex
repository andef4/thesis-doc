\section{Whitebox and blackbox methods}
Generally there are two types of methods for interpretability: Blackbox and whitebox. Whitebox methods need access to the neural network parameters (weights, biases etc.) and/or the inidiviual activations of neurons inside the networks when an image is processed by it.

Blackbox methods only work with the input (e.g. images) and the output (e.g. classes) of a neural network and can be used on arbitrary network architectures and even non-deep learning technologies like decision trees.
