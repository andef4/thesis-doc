\section{Whitebox and blackbox methods}
Generally there are two types of methods for interpretability: Blackbox and whitebox. Whitebox methods need access to the neural network parameters (weights, biases etc.) and/or the individual activations of neurons inside the networks when an image is processed by it. Some whitebox methods only work with the network parameters itself, others explain the network output for specific sample inputs.

Blackbox methods only work with the input (e.g. images) and the output (e.g. classes) of a neural network and can be used on arbitrary network architectures and even non-deep learning technologies like decision trees. Blackbox methods only work with specific sample inputs and cannot analyze the network in a general way.
