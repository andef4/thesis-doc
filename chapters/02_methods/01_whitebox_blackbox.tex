\section{Whitebox and blackbox methods}
Generally there are two types of methods for interpretability: Blackbox and whitebox. Blackbox methods like LIME or RISE do not need insight into the underlying model and can therefore be used on arbitrary network architectures and even non-deep learning technologies like decision trees.

Whitebox methods need to have access to the underling model (e.g. weights and activation values in a neural network), because they analyze a certain part of the network.
