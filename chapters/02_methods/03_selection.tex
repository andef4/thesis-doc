\section{Method selection}
The initial selection of methods contain RISE, LIME and Grad-CAM. If the modification of these methods for image segmentation is successful, additional methods will be selected.

This initial selection is mostly based on popularity and the availabilty of PyTorch implementations of the algorithms.
