\section{Method selection}
The initial selection of methods contain RISE, LIME and Grad-CAM.

LIME: Widly cited.
RISE: Proposed enhancement of LIME
Grad-CAM: Widly cited, many implementations as indicator of popularity and quality.

There are many methods, quite a few of them with PyTorch implementation.

If the modification of these methods for image segmentation is successful, additional methods will be selected.
