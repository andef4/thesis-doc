\section{Method selection}
The initial selection of methods contain RISE, LIME and Grad-CAM. If the modification of these methods for image segmentation is successful, additional methods will be selected.

This initial selection is mostly based on popularity and the availability of PyTorch implementations of the algorithms.

The

LIME: Widly cited.
RISE: Proposed enhancement of LIME
Grad-CAM: Widly cited, many implementations
