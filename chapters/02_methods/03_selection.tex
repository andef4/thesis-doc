\section{Method selection}
The selection of methods is difficult because there are many methods, newer methods supersede older methods and generally similar methods.
If it is possible to modify a method for classification to work on segmentation, it should be possible to modify similar methods in a similar way.

The selected black box methods are LIME and RISE. Grad-CAM was selected as a white box method.

LIME was selected because it has many citations (1327 on Google scholar as of June 2019) and has many implementations on GitHub. In addition, many blog posts describing how LIME works and how to apply it on a model.

RISE was selected because it is proposed as an improved version of LIME: The generated heat maps provide good insight and a high quality PyTorch implementation \cite{risegithub} exists.

Grad-CAM was selected as a white box method because it is one of the most cited (638 on Google scholar as of June 2019) and has numerous implementations on GitHub \cite{gradcamgithub}.
