\chapter{NHS Chest X-ray}
To find out what outputs the different methods generate, we started with a simple classification task in the medical image field:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  chest x-ray, sample data set (small subset)
    \item  multi label classification
    \item  current state of the art networkj: inception  resetnet v2 (accurate + fast to train on single GPU)
    \item  using learnings and code from project2
    \item  slightly modified inception resnet v2 implementation (grayscale instead of color)
    \item  did not work, convert to RGB and downscale images (offline, preprocess.ipynb)
    \item  results: 40\% validation accuracy => bad
    \item smaller batch size (citation needed) 5, => not better
    \item next: use full dataset
    \item download 42 gigs of data
    \item simple python multiprocessing for preprocessing
    \item use pretrained imagenet dataset to check if it works
\end{itemize}
