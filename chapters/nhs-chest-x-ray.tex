To find out what outputs the different methods generate, we started with a simple classification task in the medical image field:

* chest x-ray
* multi label classification

* slightly modified inception resnet v2 implementation (grayscale instead of color)
* did not work, convert to RGB and downscale images (offline, preprocess.ipynb)
* reszl
