\subsection{Conclusion}
The Hausdorff Distance Masks method works well on the BraTS dataset. It shows which regions of a specific modality are important to generate an accurate segmentation. In comparison to RISE, the generated visualization have a much higher spatial resolution, providing a better insight into the inner workings of the neural network.
