For visualization, a new blank image with the same size as the input image is generated. Next, we iterate over all the positions where masks have been
applied to input images. Each position has an associated Hausdorff distance which represents the distance of the output segment generated by the masked image and the ground truth segment.
At each position, we draw a circle with the same diameter as used when generating the mask. The color used to fill this circle represents the Hausdorff distance between the output segment generated by placing a circle at this exact position and the groun







Figure \ref{hdm_visualization_sample} shows a masked input image (a), (b) shows the baseline output segment from the unchanged image and (c) shows the segment generated by the masked image.
The segment looks completely different from the ground truth, the calculated Hausdorff distance is therefore much bigger than betwee.
