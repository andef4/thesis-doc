\section{Why interpretability?}
=> we do not understand what neural networks are doing
=> What can go wrong with NNs in the medical field?
=> many methods on image classification => show image of lime or rise

\section{Image segmentation}
=> what is it? some examples in the medical imaging field

\section{Interpretability on image segmentation}
=> does not really exist yet
