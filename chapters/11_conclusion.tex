we succeded in creating a new method, because existing methods did not deliver the results we hoped.

limitations: only circle shapes, something similar like superpixels from lime could be helpful

further work:
* investigate other white box and black box methods
* develop hdm with additional features: removing full intensity/mean/noise ,
