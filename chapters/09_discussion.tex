\section{NHS Chest X-ray dataset}
* training was difficult
* rise results looked good with some outliners
* lime was ok, adjusting superpixels count helped a bit 
* grad-cam was ok

\section{BraTS}
* training was easy
* rise acceptable results
* grad-cam did not work

\section{Testnet}
* toy example
* showed that rise does not provide good insight into the network

\section{HDM}
* our own method
* works on testnet!
* works on brats!

\section{BraTS 3D}
* applying hdm on brats 3d
* created great insight in a high quality model
