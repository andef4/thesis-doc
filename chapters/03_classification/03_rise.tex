The implementation of RISE on the NIH Chest X-ray dataset with the DenseNet model was straightforward, because the reference implementation of RISE on GitHub \cite{risegithub} already contains a working implementation for PyTorch. The implementation was not published on the Python Packaging Index, so the code had to be downloaded and added into our GitHub repository.

\subsection{Discussion}
Figure \ref{rise_example_1} shows, that the bounding box created by a physician perfectly matches the region the neural network looked to came to the correct classification. In comparison, in Figure \ref{rise_example_2} the RISE heat map shows two regions which the neural network considers import for the correct classification. In this case, consultation with a physician is required if looking at those two places is correct for the diagnosis or if the neural network is wrong here.

As a last example, Figure \ref{rise_example_3} shows a heat map where regions are highlighted that should have no influence at all at a correct diagnosis. All three generated heat maps for this class (Infiltration) look similar, and are therefore an indicator that physicians can not depend on the correct diagnosis for this class.

Most heat maps look similar to the ones in Figure \ref{rise_example_2}, showing more regions relevant for the classification than the bounding boxes. This discrepancy has to be checked with a physician an is can not easily be dismissed as an error by the neural network.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The generated heat maps by RISE allow a good and accurate insight into the inner working of the neural network. It clearly showed in which cases the network could not be trusted and in which cases the classifications where made based on the correct image region.
