\section{Conclusion}
grad-cam: Works ok
lime: lower quality than rise, prioritize rise in implementation
rise: Works good for most of the things, returns good quality, returns results for multiple classes at once which is probably helpful for segmentation

* [x] doc: chest x-ray vergleich der 3 algorithmen


performance of grad-cam much better than the other two algorithms
=> focus on rise and grad-cam
